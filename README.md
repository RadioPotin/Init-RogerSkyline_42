# Init-RogerSkyline_42

Init is the first project on the topic of Network initialisation and configuration. Init consists in a serie of forty-ish questions separated in 3 sub-topics: <i>network</i>, <i>system</i>, <i>scripting</i>.

Roger skyline 1.5 is the network project that follows right after Init. The goal is to learn about how to setup a server and get accustomed to network concepts like Port Security, Secure SHell service, DDoS, Postfix, crontab.

The subject also asks to create a secured Web page to host on our server and find a way to setup automatic deployment for it.
